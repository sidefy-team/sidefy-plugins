### FAQ

**Q: Why aren't game names and cover images displayed?**
A: Some games might not have detailed information available in the search API, showing "Game ID: xxxxx" as the title, but this doesn't affect price monitoring functionality.

**Q: What happens if I enter the wrong game ID?**
A: The plugin automatically skips invalid game IDs without affecting other game monitoring.

**Q: How many games can I monitor?**
A: Maximum 10 games supported. If you enter more than 10 IDs, the plugin will only monitor the first 10.

**Q: Are other regions supported?**
A: Current version only supports the Japan region.

**Q: Why is my ID in D70010000xxxxx format?**
A: Some third-party tools might add letter prefixes. The plugin automatically cleans them up, so you can enter them directly.
